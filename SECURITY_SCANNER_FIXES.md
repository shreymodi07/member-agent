# Security Scanner Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. "Invalid string length" Error
**Root Cause**: The security scanner was attempting to read all files in a directory recursively and concatenate them into a single string. For large codebases (like the Teladoc monorepo), this exceeded JavaScript's maximum string length limit (~512MB).

**Impact**: Complete scanner failure when scanning large directories.

### 2. "File not found" Warnings
**Root Cause**: The scanner was following symbolic links in `vendor/dependencies/` directories, which often point to non-existent or external paths.

**Impact**: Excessive warning messages cluttering the output and potential performance degradation.

### 3. Performance Issues
**Root Cause**: No limits on file sizes or total content being processed, leading to memory exhaustion and slow scans.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. File Size Limits
- **Per-file limit**: 1MB maximum per file
- **Total content limit**: 50MB maximum total content
- Files exceeding these limits are skipped with a warning
- Scanner stops gracefully when limits are reached

```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB per file
const MAX_TOTAL_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB total
```

### 2. Symlink Handling
- Changed from `fs.stat()` to `fs.lstat()` to detect symlinks without following them
- Symlinks are now skipped entirely to avoid broken references
- Resolves paths using `fs.realpath()` before processing

```typescript
// Use lstat to detect symlinks without following them
const stats = await fs.lstat(fullPath);

// Skip symlinks to avoid broken references
if (stats.isSymbolicLink()) {
  continue;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Ignore List
Added more directories to the ignore list to avoid scanning unnecessary files:
- `vendor` - External dependencies (Ruby gems, etc.)
- `tmp`, `temp`, `cache` - Temporary files
- `log`, `logs` - Log files
- `test`, `spec`, `__tests__` - Test directories
- `.bundle` - Ruby bundle cache

### 4. Test File Exclusion
Security scans now skip test files to focus on production code:
- Files matching `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`
- Files matching `*_test.*`, `*_spec.*`

### 5. Silent Error Handling
- Changed from verbose warnings to silent skipping for:
  - Missing files/directories
  - Inaccessible files (permission errors)
  - Unreadable files
- Only shows warnings for actionable issues (large files, size limits)

### 6. Ruby File Support
Added `.rb` extension to security-relevant files for Ruby codebases.

## Testing

To test the fixes, run:

```bash
# Scan current directory
npm run security

# Scan specific directory
npm run security -- --file ./path/to/directory

# Use tiered security analysis
npm run security -- --tiered

# Output to JSON
npm run security -- --format json --output security-report.json
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Memory usage**: Reduced from potentially unlimited to max 50MB
- **Scan speed**: Faster due to skipping irrelevant directories and files
- **Error handling**: More robust with graceful degradation
- **Output clarity**: Less noise from warnings about inaccessible files

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Chunked processing**: Process files in batches and aggregate results
2. **Configurable limits**: Allow users to adjust size limits via config
3. **Progress reporting**: Show which files are being scanned
4. **Smart prioritization**: Scan high-risk files first (auth, API endpoints)
5. **Incremental scanning**: Only scan changed files in git diff mode
